# Discounted Cash Flow Modelling Using Excel

## Problem Statement
The objective of this project is to assess a company's financial data to project **future cash flows**, calculate their **current value**, estimate the company's **worth at a future point**, and determine the **present value of both future cash flows and the company's future worth**. The ultimate goal is to establish the company's overall valuation through the **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** methodology.

## Expectations
You will utilize the provided **financial statements** (Income Statement, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow Statement) to:
1. **Project Free Cash Flows**: Forecast future free cash flows based on revenue projections, fixed assets schedules, and net working capital projections.
2. **Calculate Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)**: Determine the WACC to discount future cash flows to present value, a critical step for the company's valuation.
3. **Terminal Value Determination**: Compute the terminal value to represent the company’s worth beyond the forecast period.
4. **Enterprise Value Calculation**: Discount both the terminal value and projected free cash flows to present value to derive the company's overall valuation.

## Overview of the Steps
### 1. Forecasting Cash Flows
- **Free Cash Flows**: Initiate by projecting free cash flows using revenue projections, a fixed assets schedule, and a net working capital projection.
- **Revenue Projections**: Estimate future revenues based on historical data and company growth prospects.
- **Fixed Assets Schedule**: Develop a fixed assets schedule for capital expenditure and depreciation.
- **Net Working Capital**: Forecast changes in net working capital to calculate cash flow impacts.

### 2. Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) Computation
- **WACC Calculation**: Calculate the WACC to discount all future cash flows back to their present value. WACC is a weighted average of the cost of equity and the cost of debt, adjusted for the company’s capital structure.

### 3. Terminal Value Determination
- **Terminal Value**: Compute the terminal value, representing the company's worth after the forecast period ends, using the **Gordon Growth Model** or **Exit Multiple Method**.

### 4. Enterprise Value Calculation
- **Enterprise Value**: Discount both the terminal value and the forecasted free cash flows to their present value using the WACC. Sum these values to determine the company’s enterprise value, which is used to calculate its overall valuation.

## Questions to Answer
As part of the project, answer the following questions based on the financial data provided:

1. **Factors Affecting Assets Composition**: What factors can affect the composition of a company's **current assets** versus **long-term assets**?
2. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio and Creditworthiness**: How can a company's **debt-to-equity ratio** impact its **creditworthiness** and access to capital?
3. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio Trend**: How has the **debt-to-equity ratio** changed over the four years? Is the company relying more on **debt financing** or **equity financing**? (Consider total liabilities and total equity)
4. **Revenue Growth**: How has the company’s **total revenue** grown over the three years? What segments (e.g., **merchandise sales**, **membership fees**) are driving this growth?
5. **Gross Margin**: Calculate and compare the **gross margin** (consider total revenue and total operating expenses) across the three years. Is the company maintaining or improving its margins?
6. **Free Cash Flow Analysis**: How can investors utilize **free cash flow analysis** to compare different companies within the same industry?

## Tools and Technologies
- **Excel**: Used for projecting cash flows, calculating WACC, determining terminal value, and calculating enterprise value.
- **Financial Statements**: Leverage income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements for accurate analysis.

## Conclusion
This project provides a thorough analysis of the company's financial health using the **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** method to estimate future cash flows and present valuation. By calculating **WACC**, **terminal value**, and **enterprise value**, we aim to present a comprehensive assessment of the company’s worth, helping guide future investment or strategic decisions.
