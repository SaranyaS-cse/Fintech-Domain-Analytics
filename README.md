# Fintech-Domain-Analytics
 In the FinTech domain, I gained expertise in credit risk analysis through statistical modeling, financial statement evaluation, and capital structure analysis. I also explored customer segmentation techniques and regulatory compliance. These skills were applied in real-world FinTech case studies and hands-on projects.
